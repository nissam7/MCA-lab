<p style="color:dark green;">Welcome to MBITS Engineering College, a premier institution started in 2009, that is committed to providing quality education to students who are passionate about pursuing a career in engineering. We take pride in the fact that we are accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), an autonomous body established by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India to assess and accredit institutions of higher education in the country.

Our motto, “Wisdom Crowns Knowledge”, reflects our belief that true knowledge is not just about what you learn in the classroom, but also about how you apply that knowledge in real-world situations. At MBITS, we strive to provide our students with a holistic learning experience that goes beyond academic excellence. We aim to develop future leaders who are not just skilled engineers but also responsible citizens with a strong sense of social and ethical values.

We offer a wide range of undergraduate (B.Tech), postgraduate (M.Tech) and doctoral (PhD) programs in various branches of engineering. Our experienced faculty members are committed to nurturing and guiding our students through their academic journey and ensuring that they are well-prepared for their future careers. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure, modern labs, and research centres provide a conducive environment for our students to learn, grow, and innovate.

We are proud to announce that we have been recognized for our commitment to providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students. Recently, we have been honoured with two prestigious awards, the New Code of Education Awards 2021 and the Edufuture Excellence National Award 2021.
